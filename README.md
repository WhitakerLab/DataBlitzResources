## Step by Step

1. Review (or have your programme committee) review the poster abstracts and rate them.
2. Choose the top 12 abstracts.
  * You can, of course, change this number.
  * You can also, and I recommend you do, make sure you're showcasing a representative cohort of researchers. You can consider, for example:
    * gender
    * race
    * internal or external delegates
3. Edit the [instructions template email](/emails/instructions-template.md) with the correct information for your event.
  * `NAME OF CONFERENCE`
  * `DEADLINE DATE` - when you'd like the slides returned by
  * `DAY` of the data blitz
  * `START TIME` of the data blitz
  * `FINISH TIME` of the data blitz
  * `ATTENDEES` - what you call your attendees
  * `DAY BEFORE THE BLITZ` - when you'll send around the compiled slides
  * `COORDINATOR'S EMAIL` - to whom the participants should send their slides
  * `COORDINATOR'S NAME` - so you can sign off the email!
4. Send the email!
  * Don't forget to **attach the [template slides](/templates/DataBlitzSlides_TEMPLATE.pptx)**
5. Collect the slides together from the presenters into one combined slide deck. Send these slides to the presenters for them to check.
6. Edit and send the [day before email](/emails/day-before-template.md) with the appropriate information for your event.
7. Use the [host on the day](/guides/guide-host-on-the-day.md) guide to coordinate the presentations.
  Remember to keep everyone strictly to time.
8. Enjoy! üöÄ ‚ú®

The [template slides](/templates/DataBlitzSlides_TEMPLATE.pptx) were created by [Kirstie Whitaker](https://whitakerlab.github.io/about) for an event run by [Dervila Glynn](http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/directory/profile.php?dg248) for [Cambridge Neuroscience](http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/).

The slides contain two examples and we're very grateful to Franti≈°ek V√°≈°a and James Hockley for allowing us to use them.

> Franti≈°ek is finishing his PhD at the Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, funded by the Gates Cambridge Trust. He studies methods for the construction and analysis of human structural and functional brain networks, which he applies to help characterise healthy adolescent development and to identify differences between brain networks of healthy participants and patients with a range of psychiatric disorders.

> James has been based at the Department of Pharmacology, University of Cambridge since 2016 and is focussed on understanding the molecular basis of visceral sensation, specifically how we sense pain from our gastrointestinal tract in health and disease.
