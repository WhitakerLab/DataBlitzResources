# Data Blitz Resources

Everything you need to run a kickass data blitz at your event.

## Step by Step

1. Review (or have your programme committee) review the poster abstracts and rate them.
2. Choose the top 12 abstracts.
  * You can, of course, change this number.
  * You can also, and I recommend you do, make sure you're showcasing a representative cohort of researchers. You can consider, for example:
    * gender
    * race
    * internal or external delegates
3. Edit the [instructions template email](/emails/instructions-template.md) with the correct information for your event.
  * `NAME OF CONFERENCE`
  * `DEADLINE DATE` - when you'd like the slides returned by
  * `DAY` of the data blitz
  * `START TIME` of the data blitz
  * `FINISH TIME` of the data blitz
  * `ATTENDEES` - what you call your attendees
  * `DAY BEFORE THE BLITZ` - when you'll send around the compiled slides
  * `COORDINATOR'S EMAIL` - to whom the participants should send their slides
  * `COORDINATOR'S NAME` - so you can sign off the email!
4. Send the email!
  * Don't forget to **attach the [template slides](/templates/DataBlitzSlides_TEMPLATE.pptx)**
