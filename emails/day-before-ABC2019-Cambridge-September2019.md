## Email containing the combined slides and day before instructions for participation in the ABC 2019 data blitz

*SUBJECT: Instructions for tomorrow's ABC2019 data blitz*

Hi everyone

I hope you're looking forward to ABC2019!

Here are some organisational updates so you're ready to rock the data blitz tomorrow.

**Slides**

Here's a dropbox link to find the compiled slides: (`link edited out`).

(Sorry about sending the wrong link yesterday!)

I've checked that everyone's slides look good on my laptop - I've added in any of the requested changes you've sent by email, and the animations seem to be working perfectly.

You may notice that a couple of the poster numbers have changed.
That's because a couple of posters pulled out so I was working from the newest version of the programme booklet.

The slides look excellent.
Well done :)

**Logistics**

You will not have a lapel microphone.
You'll present from the lectern which has its own static microphone.

There will be a pointer at the lectern for you to use.
Please do not steal it!
Please leave it for the next person when you finish your presentation.

At the end of Dr Carl Edward Rasmussen's talk please come down to the right hand side of the stage and line up in alphabetical order by poster number.
(That's very close to last name, but not quite.
Have a look at the slides and remember who is before and after you and then say hello in the line!)

I will give a very brief introduction and then you'll get started. As I'm introducing you please come up to the lectern. I'll start the 2 minute timer after I've read your name and you're off :)

Once you've finished your presentation please head back off to the same side of the stage. Please don't go back to your seat as we don't want to distract the audience from the next presentation.


**Timing**

You will only have 2 minutes. You'll be stopped mid-sentence if you over run! Be prepared!


**Have fun!**

The slides look wonderful.
I hope you enjoy the conference.
Good luck, and have fun!

Kirstie
