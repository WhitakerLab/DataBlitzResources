## Email containing instructions for participation in the CNS 2018 data blitz

*SUBJECT: Congratulations on being selected for the CNS 2018 data blitz | Instructions for participation | DEADLINE 9 March*

Congratulations!

Your abstract has been selected as one of 12 to feature in the early career researcher data blitz as part of the [Cambridge Neuroscience Seminar on Mental Plasticity & Development](http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/events/event.php?permalink=78f6baff00)!

The data blitz requires you to present a summary of your research **in just two minutes**. It is a really fun session and it will encourage conference participants to come to your poster. Once they're there, you'll have a great opportunity to tell everyone (including the poster judges) about your research.

*The first thing to do is **reply to this email** to let me and Dervila Glynn know that you're able to participate. Please do this asap so we can find someone to replace you if needed.*

The idea of a data blitz is to keep everything moving very quickly. We'll be on stage just before lunch on Monday 12 March from 12:15pm to 12:50pm and we don't want to keep any hungry hungry neuroscientists longer than we have to!

I have a timer that will go off 2 minutes after I've introduced you. You will be stopped midsentence and hustled off stage if you haven't finished your slides.

In order to keep everything moving smoothly **I'll compile all the slides into one powerpoint presentation**. Please find attached a template slidedeck (DataBlitzSlides_TEMPLATE.pptx). I hope it's self explanatory. The long and short of it is I'd like you to **return to me a title slide and two slides that make up your presentation**.

Please be very careful when embedding videos. They *often* do not work. If you really want to embed a video please make sure to get the slides to me way in advance of the deadline so I can get back to you and tell you if everything runs correctly or not.

Animations are ok and should transfer easily. Please do not change the size or the master slide in the file I've sent so that all of your presentations fit neatly into one deck.

I'll send the running order around with the completed slides in the evening of Sunday 11 March. It will be alphabetical order by last name. In that email I'll also include some instructions for where to stand in order to keep the presentations moving smoothly. It won't be complicated, just be in line at the side of the stage in the correct order and walk up when it's your turn :)

So, here's your to do list:

* Confirm that you'll take part in the Data Blitz
* Download the template slidedeck attached here (**DataBlitzSlides_TEMPLATE.pptx**) and rename as **DataBlitzSlides_[YOUR-NAME].pptx** (eg: DataBlitzSlides_Kirstie-Whitaker.pptx)
* Edit the slides to best show off your awesome research
* Send the slides back to me at kw401@cam.ac.uk and Dervila at dg248@cam.ac.uk BEFORE **Friday 9 March at 12noon**. (Earlier if you have videos!)
* Practise your presentation to keep it to time
* Have fun at CNS 2018!

Thank you! I'm really excited to hear more about your research. The presentations at previous Data Blitzes have received uniformly positive feedback, mostly from senior members of the audience. I'm confident you're going to shine just as brightly at this event :)

PS: I'm taking part in the [UCU industrial action](https://www.ucu.org.uk/strike-action) which means I will not reply to emails on strike days (currently scheduled for Monday to Thursday next week). I will be working on Friday 9 March, and if the strike is still on during the conference Dervila will host the Data Blitz for me.

The conference is not held on University of Cambridge property, it is held at Robinson College, so you will not be asked to cross a picket line to take part in CNS2018. I've chosen to withdraw my labour in hosting the Data Blitz on a strike day, but I REALLY hope the talks next week will be successful and that I'll be able to introduce you (and chase you off stage if you go over time)!

If you have any questions on strike days please cc Dervila Glynn (dg248@cam.ac.uk) in your email and she will be able to answer them.
