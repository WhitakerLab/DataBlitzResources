## Email containing the combined slides and day before instructions for participation in the CNS 2018 data blitz

*SUBJECT: Instructions for tomorrow's CNS2018 data blitz*

Hi everyone

I hope you've had a great weekend and are looking forward to CNS2018!

Here are some organisational updates so you're ready to rock the data blitz tomorrow.

**Slides**

Here's a dropbox link to find the compiled slides: (`link edited out`).

I've checked that everyone's slides look good on my laptop - all the animations seem to be working perfectly. They all look excellent too! Well done :)

Some of you had changed your title slides: I've reformatted them back to the template style now. This is partly to make the presentation look really cohesive but mostly just my personal compulsion to have everything just so!

**Logistics**

You will not have a lapel microphone. You'll present from the lectern which has its own static microphone.

At the end of Paul Ramchandani's talk please come down to the right hand side of the stage and line up in alphabetical order by last name.

Unfortunately, the USS strike is still going on so I'm not able to host the event. Bianca Jupp will be taking my place. She's wonderful and you'll be in very good hands. But I'll be writing to her to emphasise how important it is to stay to time. She'll be ready to boot you off stage when your 2 minutes are up!

Bianca will give a very brief introduction and then you'll get started. As Bianca is introducing you please come up to the lectern. She'll start the 2 minute timer after she's read your name and you're off :)

Once you've finished your presentation please head back off to the same side of the stage. Please don't go back to your seat as we don't want to distract the audience from the next presentation.


**Timing**

You will only have 2 minutes. You'll be stopped mid-sentence if you over run! Be prepared!


**Have fun!**

I hope you enjoy the conference. I'm very sorry I can't be there tomorrow. Your slides look really fantastic.

Good luck!

Kirstie
