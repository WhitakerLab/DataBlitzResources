## Email containing instructions for participation in the ABC2019 data blitz

*SUBJECT: Congratulations on being selected for the ABC2019 data blitz | Instructions for participation | DEADLINE 6 September*

Congratulations!

Your abstract has been selected as one of 12 to feature in the early career researcher data blitz as part of the Cambridge Neuroscience Seminar on [Artificial and Biological Cognition](http://www.neuroscience.cam.ac.uk/events/ABC2019)!

The data blitz requires you to present a summary of your research **in just two minutes**. It is a really fun session and it will encourage conference participants to come to your poster. Once they're there, you'll have a great opportunity to tell everyone (including the poster judges) about your research.

*The first thing to do is **reply to this email** to let me and Dervila Glynn know that you're able to participate. Please do this asap so we can find someone to replace you if needed.*

(If you have already replied to Dervila's previous email you don't need to send another confirmation.)

The idea of a data blitz is to keep everything moving very quickly. We'll be on stage just before lunch on Thursday 12 September from 11:40am to 12:10pm and we don't want to keep any hungry hungry neuroscientists longer than we have to!

I have a timer that will go off 2 minutes after I've introduced you. You will be stopped midsentence and hustled off stage if you haven't finished your slides.

In order to keep everything moving smoothly **I'll compile all the slides into one powerpoint presentation**. Please find attached a template slidedeck (DataBlitzSlides_TEMPLATE.pptx). I hope it's self explanatory. The long and short of it is I'd like you to **return to me a title slide and two slides that make up your presentation**.

Please be very careful when embedding videos. They *often* do not work. If you really want to embed a video please make sure to get the slides to me way in advance of the deadline so I can get back to you and tell you if everything runs correctly or not.

Animations are ok and should transfer easily. Please do not change the size or the master slide in the file I've sent so that all of your presentations fit neatly into one deck. Please also do not add logos or additional information to the title slide.

The last slide before the examples is my data collection tool.
The information there will help me schedule live tweets about your presentation.
I don't have to tweet anything except the title slide (which is the title of your poster and listed publicly on the ABC2019 website already).
The most open answers will have me schedule a custom tweet about the talk, with pictures of the slides, and have the slides included in an archived online version that folks can access and cite in the future.
I'd love to be able to share your work far and wide ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ

I'll send the running order around with the completed slides in the evening of Tuesday 10 September. It will be alphabetical order by last name. In that email I'll also include some instructions for where to stand in order to keep the presentations moving smoothly. It won't be complicated, just be in line at the side of the stage in the correct order and walk up when it's your turn :)

So, here's your to do list:

* Confirm that you'll take part in the Data Blitz
* Download the template slidedeck attached here (**DataBlitzSlides_TEMPLATE.pptx**) and rename as **DataBlitzSlides_[YOUR-NAME].pptx** (eg: DataBlitzSlides_Kirstie-Whitaker.pptx)
* Edit the slides to best show off your awesome research
* Complete the questions in the slide deck about tagging the right people in tweets and sharing images of the slides
* Send the slides back to me at kw401@cam.ac.uk and Dervila at dg248@cam.ac.uk BEFORE **Friday 6 September at 12noon**. (Earlier if you have videos!)
* Practise your presentation to keep it to time
* Have fun at ABC2019!

Thank you! I'm really excited to hear more about your research. The presentations at previous Data Blitzes have received uniformly positive feedback, mostly from senior members of the audience. I'm confident you're going to shine just as brightly at this event :)

PS: As Dervila said in her email, I'm on holiday today until Tuesday. I'll reply to any questions on Wednesday morning.
